# Document AI PDF Annotator and Table Extractor

This repository contains Python scripts that utilize Google Cloud's Document AI API to process PDF documents. The project consists of two main components:

1. PDF Annotator
2. Table Extractor

## PDF Annotator

The PDF Annotator script (`pdf-annotator-python/main.py`) uses Document AI to analyze a PDF form and add annotations to it based on the detected form fields.

### Features:
- Processes PDF documents using Document AI Form Parser
- Detects form fields and their values
- Adds annotations to the PDF with field names and values
- Saves the annotated PDF with disabled annotation modification
